That’s what being a North Star camper is all about. It doesn’t take long for campers to become part of our family and for our beautiful 200-acre property to become their summer home.

The combination of North Star’s value system, the RICHS, and our emphasis on teaching 21st century life skills is part of what sets us apart from other camps. It is the foundation of who we are as a camp, and it allows us to help each camper become the best version of themselves.

The RICHS represent the moral fabric of our community and we strive every day to highlight these qualities in each camper. At North Star, there’s no award for most popular camper or best athlete. Instead, each summer we “recognize” the campers that best display each of these five values. One of our goals is for campers to not only live their life at camp by the RICHS, but for it to become their own personal value system at home.",,,,0,9/2/2025,9/2/2025,"Coed Camp |

Time seems to stand still as the canoe glides through the cool, clear waters of Lake Androscoggin. Only the rhythmic slap of paddles breaks the silence of the summer afternoon. The lake, five miles wide and six miles long, is encircled by a forest of fir, pine, maple and a dozen other species of trees that form the Maine wilderness. There, carved out of 120 acres along the shoreline of the lake, is Camp Androscoggin. Founded in 1907, our camp is located in Wayne, 20 miles west of Augusta, the state capitol.

This is the spectacular setting at the heart of the unique and enduring Androscoggin Experience.
